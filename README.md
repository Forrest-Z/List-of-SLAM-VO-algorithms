# Purpose
While doing some research on SLAM / VO for my Masterthesis I noticed that there
is no list which is up to date and holds all currently available SLAM
algorithms. Since the search took a long time and I wish no one else to have to
do the same thing I figured I should probably just make this list public. So,
here you go a list of all the SLAM algorithms/ topics I was able to find,
related references, a link to the code if available, which sensors are being used
and a few quick notes what is special about the implementation. Feel free to extend and
use the list as you wish.

Note: This is a work in progress, I wasn't able to check all references yet so
please don't be offended if a reference is not perfect or a link in the
references doesn't work.
